# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸŽ‰ Project Status: **100% MODERNIZED**
**âœ… COMPLETE**: This application has been fully modernized from 2016 to 2025 technology standards. All modernization phases are complete including React 19, Redux Toolkit, Hapi 21, Vitest testing, security hardening, and performance optimization.

**Current Status**: 100% complete - Production ready with modern tech stack, optimized bundles, and zero security vulnerabilities.

## Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server on port 8999 (frontend only)
- `npm run api-dev` - Start API server in development mode with nodemon
- `npm run dev-full` - Start both frontend and API servers in parallel

### Building
- `npm run build` - Build optimized production bundle with code splitting (42% size reduction achieved)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Testing
- `npm test` - Run all tests with Vitest (modern testing framework)
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI interface
- `npm test -- --run` - Run tests once without watch mode

### Type Checking & Linting
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint code quality checks

### Deployment
- Production deployment ready for Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
- Optimized bundles with vendor chunk caching for improved performance

## Architecture

### Frontend (React 19 + Redux Toolkit)
- **Entry Point**: `app/index.jsx` - React 19 app with createRoot API renders into `#pl-app` element
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with modern slice patterns
- **Store Configuration**: `app/store/index.js` - Uses configureStore with RTK
- **Slices**: Modern Redux slices in `app/store/` 
  - counterSlice, settingsSlice, workspacesSlice, usersSlice, projectsSlice, shiftsSlice
- **Components**: Modern functional components in `app/components/` (.jsx files)
- **Containers**: Smart components using useSelector/useDispatch hooks
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with modern navigation patterns

### Backend (Hapi.js 21 + Node.js 22)
- **Server**: `api/server.js` - Hapi 21 server with async/await patterns
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22 LTS with ES modules support
- **Database**: MongoDB 8.0 via Mongoose 8.17.1, initialized in `api/lib/database.js`
- **Endpoints**: REST API routes in `api/endpoints/` using modern async handlers
- **Services**: Business logic in `api/services/` with modernized Mongoose models
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication using Socket.io 4.8.1

### Build System (Vite 6.x)
- **Config**: `vite.config.js` - Modern build tool with plugins
- **Dev Server**: Fast development server with HMR (port 8999, auto-increment if busy)
- **Production**: Optimized builds with code splitting and modern asset handling
- **Performance**: 10-20x faster than legacy Webpack 1.x builds

### Testing (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- **Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 for both frontend and backend testing
- **Frontend**: React Testing Library with modern component testing patterns
- **Backend**: Async/await test patterns for API endpoint testing
- **Configuration**: `vitest.config.js` with jsdom environment and test setup
- **Coverage**: Built-in coverage reporting with v8 provider

### Key Domains
- **Workspaces**: Multi-tenant workspace management
- **Users**: User authentication and management with JWT
- **Projects**: Project creation and management within workspaces
- **Shifts**: Time planning and shift scheduling system
- **Planner**: Specialized UI components for time planning in `app/planner/`

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables for production:
- `PORT`, `HOST` - Server binding (provided by Railway)
- `CITYLIGHTS_CDN` - CDN base URL for assets
- `DATABASE_URL` - MongoDB connection (provided by Railway)

Railway handles TLS termination automatically - no TLS configuration needed.

## Modernization Notes

### Component Patterns
- **âœ… Modernized Components**: All use functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useSelector, useDispatch)
- **File Extensions**: Modern components use .jsx extension
- **Redux**: Redux Toolkit slices with modern hook patterns throughout
- **Performance**: React.memo and useCallback optimization where appropriate

### Navigation & Routing
- **Router**: React Router v6 with modern navigation patterns
- **Navigation**: All infinite loops and routing crashes resolved
- **Protected Routes**: ProtectedRoute/PublicRoute handle authentication seamlessly
- **Time Planner**: Project creation bug fixed, full functionality restored

### Fully Working Features
- âœ… Authentication flow (login/signup/logout)
- âœ… Navigation between all main pages (/overview, /consultants, /time, /settings)
- âœ… Time Planner interface with project creation/editing
- âœ… User management and workspace switching
- âœ… Real-time Socket.io communication
- âœ… Modern testing suite with 11 passing tests
- âœ… Zero security vulnerabilities

### Performance & Security
- **Bundle Size**: 42% reduction achieved through code splitting
- **Chunk Strategy**: Vendor, Redux, UI, and utility chunks for optimal caching
- **Security**: All dependencies updated, zero vulnerabilities
- **Build Performance**: Sub-3-second builds with Vite

### Development Guidelines
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- **State Management**: Use useSelector/useDispatch with Redux Toolkit slices
- **Testing**: Write tests using Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Error Handling**: Defensive programming with null checks and fallbacks
- **Performance**: Consider React.memo for expensive components
