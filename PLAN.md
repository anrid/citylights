- **Parallel development**: Run old and new systems side-by-side during migration
- **Comprehensive testing**: Test every user flow after each migration step

### 2. Look & Feel Preservation
- **CSS snapshot testing**: Capture visual regression tests before migration
- **Design system documentation**: Document current visual patterns
- **Staged rollout**: Gradual deployment to catch visual issues early

### 3. Data Integrity
- **Database migration testing**: Test MongoDB upgrades on copies of production data
- **Backup strategies**: Full backups before each major database change
- **Rollback procedures**: Clear rollback plans for each phase

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Maintain 100% test coverage during migration
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Add Playwright/Cypress for critical user flows
- **Visual Regression**: Implement visual testing for UI consistency

### 2. Manual Testing
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Test all major features after each phase
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on all supported browsers
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark before/after performance

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. New Scripts (package.json)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8999",
    "build": "vite build",

    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx,js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Modern Development Tools
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
